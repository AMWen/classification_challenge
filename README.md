# classification_challenge
This repository consists of R code for different statistical and machine learning classification techniques on a de-identified dataset.

Cross-validation was used to analyze the various strategies to achieve greatest accuracies and sensitivities for the classification problem.

Among the strategies tested were: logistic regression, LDA/QDA classifiers, random forest, SVM with radial kernel, and neural network.
